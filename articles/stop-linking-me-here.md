Too often I'm communicating with someone or reading some documentation and it comes time to point me elsewhere. Maybe it's a JIRA. Maybe I'm being directed to another page in the docs. Or maybe I'm being directed to a source for some bold claim being made.

"Here?" I ask myself. **Where is here?**

I scan the sentence until I find where they want me to look. A small link, barely visible put at the end of the sentence. Aaah... its right [there]().

Why is it so undiscoverable? Why do I have to point my cursor over this one singular word in order to click on the link?

There's nothing wrong with telling me [to look here for more information](), or to [check out this story for more details]().

Lets stop being terse in our links. Just make the whole damn sentence a hyperlink for all I care. But enough of [this](). I've had it up to [here]().
